* getdigicamdata.sh

This script gets data from the SD storage card of my digital camera
to my computer. It rotates portrait format images and renames files
according to my file name convention. It works on GNU/Linux and
probably on OS X.

Please note: this is a *quick-hack* script that needs clean-up, a more
beautiful formatting, and proably a re-implementation in Python (to be
platform-independent).

It is part of a blog article, where I describe my work-flows on how I
manage my photographs and more.
